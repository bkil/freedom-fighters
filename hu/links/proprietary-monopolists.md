> _Facebook Banned Me for Life Because I Help People Use It Less_
> The tool I created, a browser extension called Unfollow Everything, allowed users to delete their News Feed by unfollowing their friends, groups, and pages. 
> Facebook sent me a cease-and-desist letter. The company demanded that I take down the tool. It also told me that it had permanently disabled my Facebook account—an account that I’d had for more than 15 years, and that was my primary way of staying in touch with family and friends around the world. Pointing to **a provision in its terms of service that purports to bind even _former users_ of Facebook**, Facebook also demanded that I never again create a tool that interacts with Facebook or its many other services in any way.
