# Music Services

## Goal

* Discover new music  
* Share what we're listening to or our favorite styles on social media  
* Ideally, listen on older devices or when we're offline or have poor reception  
* Decentralize the corporate monopoly status quo in favor of independent creators, free content, and open-source software  
  * [Comparison of music streaming services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_music_streaming_services)  
* Preference for sustainable, free, non-tracking services; if paid, DRM-free and possibly usable via FLOSS clients; alternatives that allow deep-link sharing on social media
